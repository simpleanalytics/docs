Simple Analytics prioritizes the integrity and confidentiality of customer data. Our data governance meets the best practices in the industry: we continuously update our code to address vulnerabilities, employ firewalls, encrypt and regularly back up the data, and restrict access to customer data to our dev team.

We do everything in our power to keep your data safe. We collect the bare minimum amount of data required to give you a broad picture of your website’s visitors and even go a few steps further.

## Data Hosting Infrastructure

The data we collect belongs to you. We only collect non-personal data and don’t share the data with third parties or transfer it overseas. Your website data never leaves the Netherlands and, therefore, the E.U. Also, no other third-party vendors have access to any data outside the hosting company that owns the servers on which the data is stored.

The data is hosted fully secured and encrypted in The Netherlands, [part of the EU](https://european-union.europa.eu/principles-countries-history/country-profiles/netherlands_en). [Worldstream](https://www.worldstream.com/) and [Leaseweb](https://www.leaseweb.com/) own the servers, both dutch companies that adhere to EU law and GDPR policy.

We use a CDN for most of our customers. The CDN is called Bunny CDN and is part of a company called [BunnyWay](https://bunny.net/cdn/), located in Slovenia, [part of the EU](https://european-union.europa.eu/principles-countries-history/country-profiles/slovenia_en). Simple Analytics and Bunny CDN have signed a written agreement protecting data exits.

## Data Security

[Simple Analytics](https://simpleanalytics.com/) (and our hosting parties) possess organizational and technical measures to protect the data. Customer data is encrypted both at rest and in transit. Only Simple Analytics holds the decryption keys, ensuring data confidentiality. Even our hosting providers cannot access the data in the clear. Any questions related to our security policy and measures can be sent to info@simpleanalytics.com

## Data Retention

In order to provide our service, Simple Analytics will retain your data for as long as your account is active. We won’t store your data longer than necessary. Once you delete your account, you can export your data and [delete the data from our servers](https://docs.simpleanalytics.com/delete-account). The data will be deleted immediately when you delete your account (but will only be permanently deleted after 90 days).

## We Don’t Sell Your Data

Simple Analytics does not use or sell your data to third parties. Data access is limited to Simple Analytics and trusted service providers. All our providers are contractually obligated to only use the data as needed to power our service: they cannot disclose it, sell it, or use it for their own ends.

## No data transfer to the US

We don’t transfer your visitors’ data outside of the EU. This includes no data transfer to the United States of America.

The EU-US Privacy Shield Framework was invalidated by the Court of Justice of the European Union in the 2020 [“Schrems II”](https://iapp.org/news/a/the-schrems-ii-decision-eu-us-data-transfers-in-question/) decision. The invalidation of the Privacy Shield makes data transfer to the US risky and tricky compared to other countries..

Ever since the start of our business in 2018, we have only relied on European service providers. This is a choice. The data we collect are not personal and do not fall under the GDPR. It can be transferred anywhere with no legal issues. In fact, **we can lawfully transfer data to our customers located outside the EU**.

## Protecting your privacy

What do we do to protect your privacy and that of your visitors?

1.  **We only collect what we need and nothing more.** This data probably won’t be of much interest to thieves.
2.  **You are in control of your data, and you can download or delete it at any time.** We don’t own any of it.
3.  **The drives storing your data are fully encrypted.** If anybody did manage to steal them, they’d be useless.
4.  **We will never sell your data.** Because, once again, it’s yours!
