## GDPR and UK GDPR Compliance

Simple Analytics fully adheres to GDPR and UK GDPR regulations by **refraining from collecting any personal data from end users** (that is, visitors of a customer’s website or app users). We do not place cookies, collect IP addresses, or use device identifiers.

Our data minimization strategy is fundamental to our ethics and simplifies compliance. Since GDPR and UK GDPR govern personal data, our approach of not collecting such data ensures full compliance and significantly reduces our customers' compliance burdens as well.

Several providers of web analytics claim GDPR compliance by collecting non-personal data, but the claims are not always true. Sometimes the data is combined in a way that makes the user identifiable and enables tracking- which qualifies as personal data under the GDPR.

At Simple Analytics, **when we say we do not collect personal data, we mean it**. Our non-personal data collection is not combined in a way that can track or identify users- and would not be sufficient to do so anyway. We offer genuine compliance, not dubious legal workarounds.

## ePrivacy, PECR, and TTDSG Compliance

Article 5(3) of the EU’s ePrivacy Directive protects data stored on end-user devices. Simple Analytics complies effortlessly by not collecting such data.

This approach also ensures compliance with the PECR (UK) and TTDSG (Germany), which are implementations of the ePrivacy Directive within national laws.

## CCPA compliance

Simple Analytics is **CCPA compliant out of the box** because it avoids collecting any information that falls under the CCPA.

The CCPA applies to the personal information and defines “personal information” as “information that identifies, relates to, or could reasonably be linked with a user or their household”. Simple Analytics collects no such information from the end user.

## HIPAA Compliance

HIPAA protects protected health information (PHI). To qualify as PHI, information must meet several criteria under Section 262(a), including the ability to identify an individual (“identifies the individual or for which there is a reasonable basis to believe can be used to identify the individual”).

Simple Analytics avoids collecting any data that meets this requirement, ensuring the service is 100% HIPAA-compliant out of the box.

## Compliance FAQ

### Does Simple Analytics collect personal data?

**Simple Analytics does not collect personal data**. We do not use cookies or similar tracking technologies. We are also careful to avoid collecting any metrics that could be used for finger-printing and singling out a user (Recital 26 GDPR). None of the data we collect fall under the GDPR.

Simple Analytics **drops IP addresses** and **never processes them**. 

### What does Simple Analytics do with IP addresses?

When IP addresses are sent to us, they are immediately discarded after each request. We do not process, log, store, or transfer IP addresses at any point.

Optionally, Simple Analytics can check IP addresses against a list of known bot addresses. This allows us to filter out the data for bots and keep your analytics accurate. Even in this scenario, IP addresses are discarded immediately after the check.

### What is Simple Analytics’ role in the processing of the data?

The notions of data controller and data processor are defined concerning personal data by the GDPR (see Articles 4(7) and (8) GDPR). We only collect anonymous metrics. Therefore, **we are neither data controllers nor data processors** concerning the data we collect and process for our customers.

Simple Analytics is a **sole** **data controller** concerning IP addresses.

### What are your legal bases for processing the data?

The anonymized metrics collected by Simple Analytics are not personal data. They do not fall under the GDPR, and Articles 5(1)(a) and 6 do not apply to them. **No legal basis is needed to process anonymous data**.

IP addresses are processed by Simple Analytics as a sole data controller based on its **legitimate interest** (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) to provide the service.

### What legal bases can I rely upon to process the data?

Using Simple Analytics does not make you a controller of personal data. **You do not need a legal basis** to process the data, as the GDPR and the principle of lawfulness (5(1)(a) GDPR) do not apply to anonymous data.

### Do I need a DPA to use Simple Analytics?

You do not need to sign a data processing agreement with Simple Analytics, as we do not collect personal data and are not considered a processor under GDPR and UK GDPR. However, we are available to discuss custom agreements regarding data protection issues.

### Does Simple Analytics use third-party providers?

We rely on Dutch companies Worldserver and Leaseweb to store data. We also rely on BunnyCDN to deliver content. BunnyCDN is part of Slovenian company BunnyWay.

Worldserver, Leaseweb, and Bunnyweb are **trusted, European, and GDPR-compliant providers with infrastructure located in the EU**. We don’t need to use European providers, as non-personal data can be transferred without limitations under the GDPR. We still choose to do so to ensure that the processing is as transparent and confidential as possible.

### Does Simple Analytics require a privacy notice or a privacy policy?

**Simple Analytics does not require a privacy notice**. Our customers are not controllers of personal data and are not required to provide any information under Art. 13 GDPR, as the provision only applies to the data controller.

For the same reason, it is not mandatory to include Simple Analytics in a website’s privacy policy. We still encourage our customers to do so to be as transparent as possible. [This page](/your-privacy-policy)

### How can I add Simple Analytics to my privacy policy?

Adding us to your privacy policy is not strictly necessary, but we still encourage you to do so in order to be as transparent as possible with your visitors. This is a template you can use or take inspiration from:

We use anonymous metrics to understand how you use your website and where our traffic comes from. We use this insight to improve our website and create a better experience for visitors. We do not track you, serve personalized advertising, or sell the data to anyone.
