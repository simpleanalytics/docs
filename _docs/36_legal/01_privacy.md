At Simple Analytics, our mission is to make web analytics intuitive, ethical, and privacy-friendly. We empower organizations of all sizes with straightforward and actionable insights into their website traffic while easing compliance burdens and helping build trust with customers and visitors.

Privacy is not an afterthought; it is **the cornerstone of what we do**. Here are the steps we take to ensure data is treated ethically and in compliance with privacy legislation.

## Our No-tracking Philosophy

**Data minimization** is the core philosophy of Simple Analytics. **We do not collect personal data** from the end user of your app and website- not a single bit.

We only collect non-personal data such as UTM codes, referrer, time zone (as a privacy-preserving proxy for country), and anonymized user agent values. These data points cannot be combined to track individual users or infringe on user privacy. We only use this data to provide aggregate metrics and nothing else. We drop IP addresses, do not store cookies, and do not collect or generate device identifiers.

Bottom line: we do not track people, period.

## No Consent Requirement

By not collecting personal data, we allow customers to use Simple Analytics **without needing consent** from end users or website visitors. This builds trust with users, provides a frictionless experience without annoying pop-ups, and avoids the significant data loss caused by cookie rejection and ad blockers. Some clients even use Simple Analytics alongside traditional cookie-based solutions to mitigate data loss from opt-outs.

## No Data Transfers

We don’t transfer your visitors’ data outside of the EU. Our customers can move their Simple Analytics data anywhere in the world without the compliance burdens associated with data transfers.

Ever since we started our business in 2018, we have only relied on European service providers. This is a choice. The data we collect is not personal and does not fall under the GDPR. It can be transferred anywhere with no legal issues and can be lawfully sent to our customers located outside the EU, including non-Privacy Shield-certified US customers.
