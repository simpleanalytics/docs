At Simple Analytics, our mission is to make web analytics **intuitive, ethical, and privacy-friendly**. We empower private and public organizations of all sizes with straightforward and actionable insights on traffic and user behavior, easing compliance burdens and helping build trust with customers and visitors.

Privacy is not an afterthought; it is **the cornerstone of what we do**. Here are the steps we take to ensure data is treated ethically and in compliance with privacy legislation.

## Our No-Tracking Philosophy

**Data minimization** is the core philosophy of Simple Analytics. **We do not collect personal data** from the end user of your app and website- not a single bit.

We only collect non-personal data such as UTM codes, referrer, time zone (as a privacy-preserving proxy for country), and anonymized user agent values. These data points cannot be combined to track individual users or infringe on user privacy. We only use this data to provide aggregate metrics and nothing else. We drop IP addresses, do not store cookies, and do not collect or generate device identifiers.

Bottom line: we do not track people, period.

## No Consent Requirement

By not collecting personal data, we allow customers to use Simple Analytics **without needing consent** from end users or website visitors. This builds trust with users, provides a frictionless experience without annoying pop-ups, and avoids the significant data loss caused by cookie rejection and ad blockers. Some clients even use Simple Analytics alongside traditional cookie-based solutions to mitigate data loss from opt-outs.

## No Data Transfers

We provide our service **without transferring data** outside the European Union. We rely on trusted, GDPR-compliant European data processors with data centers in the EU.

Because we do not collect personal data, we can forward data to our customers outside the EU with no compliance burden. This allows you to use Simple Analytics anywhere in the world without worrying about data transfers.

## Data Storage and Retention

Your data is stored on dedicated servers provided by Worldstream and Leaseweb - our trusted, EU-based service providers. We retain your data as long as you use the service. Upon account deletion, data is erased from our systems, with backups deleted within 90 days.

## You Own Your Data

Simple Analytics makes no claim over your data. We do not store, sell, or use it for our purposes. **Your data belongs to you**.

Your subscription pays for the service - not your data. We are an independently funded company with no ties to large corporations or the ad tech industry and do not use your data for marketing, for retargeting, for developing other services, and so on. And of course, we do not sell it.

## Integrations and Portability

We give customers full ownership and value from their data. Our plugins seamlessly integrate with services like Google Tag Manager, CloudQuery, and WordPress. Our raw data export feature allows former customers to retain and use their data as they see fit.
