Simple Analytics prioritizes the integrity and confidentiality of customer data. Our data governance meets the best practices in the industry: we continuously update our code to address vulnerabilities, employ firewalls, encrypt and regularly back up the data, and restrict access to customer data to our dev team.

## Dedicated, EU-Based Servers

We rely on trusted, EU-based hosting providers (Worldstream and Leaseweb). Your data never leaves the EU, ensuring strict adherence to privacy legislation. We use dedicated servers to minimize cybersecurity risks.

## Encryption at Rest and in Transit

Customer data is encrypted both at rest and in transit. Only Simple Analytics holds the decryption keys, ensuring data confidentiality. Even our hosting providers cannot access the data in the clear.

## We Donâ€™t Sell Your Data

Simple Analytics does not use or sell your data to third parties. Data access is limited to Simple Analytics and trusted service providers. All our providers are contractually obligated to only use the data as needed to power our service: they cannot disclose it, sell it, or use it for their own ends.
