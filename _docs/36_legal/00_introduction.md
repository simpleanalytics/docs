We at Simple Analytics believe in a free, user-friendly Internet. This is why we built a simple, privacy-friendly tool to provide you with valuable analytics insights without collecting personal data from your visitors. This privacy-first mindset makes our software compliant with the strictest privacy regulations, including the GDPR.

## Data collection

**We do not collect any personal data**. We do not use cookies and never collect information that could be used to fingerprint a user. You do not need to tweak any settings to make our software privacy-friendly: **Simple Analytics is privacy-friendly by design**.

Our minimal data collection still allows us to provide very valuable insights, including unique visitors, time on page, and the source of your traffic.

You can find more information about the data we collect [here](/what-we-collect).

## Compliance

**Simple Analytics is 100% GDPR compliant with data protection law from installation**. Because it only processes anonymous data, it can satisfy the requirements of the strictest privacy regulation, including the GDPR, the ePrivacy Directive, the UK GDPR, and the PECT.

Simple Analytics **does not require pop-ups** such as consent banners or privacy notices, allowing for a seamless user experience on your website.

Simple Analytics **does not need to transfer data** outside the EU to provide its service but can do so in order to provide non-EU customers with the data they need.

Finally, **you do not need to sign a Data Processing Agreement** to use Simple Analytics!

You can find out more about our compliance [here](/compliance-fore-legal-teams). We also have a separate page for more in-depth compliance information for your legal team.

## How we protect your data

Your data are **fully encrypted** on our servers. We only rely on **European, GDPR-compliant providers** for our processing to ensure that your data are handled as safely as possible.

We retain your data as long as your Simple Analytics account is active and never share the data with third parties. **You control your data** and can export it at any time.
