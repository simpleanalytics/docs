Simple Analytics prioritizes the integrity and confidentiality of customer data. Our data governance meets the best practices in the industry: we continuously update our code to address vulnerabilities, employ firewalls, encrypt and regularly back up the data, and restrict access to customer data to our dev team.

We do everything in our power to keep your data safe. We collect the bare minimum amount of data required to give you a broad picture of your website’s visitors and even go a few steps further.

## Data Hosting Infrastructure

The data we collect belongs to you. We only collect non-personal data and don’t share the data with third parties or transfer it overseas. Your website data never leaves the Netherlands and, therefore, the EU. Also, no service providers receive any data except for our hosting provider- who is under binding obligations of confidentiality.

The data is hosted fully secured and encrypted in The Netherlands, [part of the EU](https://european-union.europa.eu/principles-countries-history/country-profiles/netherlands_en). [Worldstream](https://www.worldstream.com/) and [Leaseweb](https://www.leaseweb.com/) own the servers, both Dutch companies that adhere to EU law and GDPR policy.

We use a CDN for most of our customers. The CDN is called Bunny CDN and is part of a company called [BunnyWay](https://bunny.net/cdn/), located in Slovenia, [part of the EU](https://european-union.europa.eu/principles-countries-history/country-profiles/slovenia_en).

## Data Security

[Simple Analytics](https://simpleanalytics.com/) (and our hosting parties) possess organizational and technical measures to protect the data. Customer data is encrypted both at rest and in transit. Only Simple Analytics holds the decryption keys, ensuring data confidentiality. Even our hosting providers cannot access the data in the clear. Any questions related to our security policy and measures can be sent to <info@simpleanalytics.com>

## Data Retention

In order to provide its service, Simple Analytics will retain your data in line with your subscription plan and only when your account is active. We won’t store your data longer than necessary. Once you delete your account, you can export your data and [delete the data from our servers](https://docs.simpleanalytics.com/delete-account). The data will be deleted immediately when you delete your account (but will only be permanently deleted after 90 days).

## No data transfers

We provide our service **without transferring data** outside the European Union. We rely on trusted, GDPR-compliant European data processors with data centers in the EU.

Because we do not collect personal data, we can forward data to our customers outside the EU with no compliance burden. This allows you to use Simple Analytics anywhere in the world without worrying about data transfers.

## Integrations and Portability

We give customers full ownership and value from their data. Our plugins seamlessly integrate with services like Google Tag Manager, CloudQuery, and WordPress. Our raw data export feature allows former customers to retain and use their data as they see fit.

## You Own Your Data

Simple Analytics makes no claim over your data. We do not store, sell, or use it for our purposes. **Your data belongs to you**.

Your subscription pays for the service - not your data. We are an independently funded company with no ties to large corporations or the ad tech industry and do not use your data for marketing, for retargeting, for developing other services, and so on.

## We Don’t Sell Your Data

Simple Analytics does not use or sell your data to third parties. Data access is limited to Simple Analytics and trusted service providers. All our providers are contractually obligated to only use the data as needed to power our service: they cannot disclose it, sell it, or use it for their own ends.
