## Analyst

Analysts can add, change, and remove goals, update views (but not delete them), and change some website settings. They can export raw data if included in the plan. Analysts cannot reset website data.

## Developer

Developers can access dashboards, add websites to the team, and change website settings like visibility (public/private), custom domain, and alerts for no traffic. They can also reset website data.

## Finance Manager

Finance Managers can change billing info, manage subscriptions, and cancel subscriptions.

## Viewer

Read-Only Users have read-only permissions. They cannot edit goals or website settings but can change their own account settings.

## General Permissions

All accounts can delete their own account.
