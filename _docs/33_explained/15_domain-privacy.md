We believe adding a website should be simple and stress-free:

## Painless process

-	Great onboarding flow:
    - Suggests plugins that match your site.
    - Shows each step in a clean, visual way.
    - Easy to share with your tech team.
-	No extra steps required:
    - You don’t need to create a website in the dashboard before adding the embed script.
    - Domain verification is unnecessary.
    - Forget about creating website IDs—just copy and paste the script!

It’s as easy as it gets.

## Privacy

Our embed script automatically detects the website name from the URL ([you can overwrite it](/overwrite-domain-name) if needed), so there’s no manual input required. If a customer decides to leave Simple Analytics, we take steps to ensure data security. We store a hash of any deleted website and check new additions against this list. If there’s a match, we’ll require domain verification.

## Transfer websites
