**Data minimization** is the core philosophy of Simple Analytics. **We do not collect personal data** from the end user of your app and website- not a single bit.

We only collect non-personal data such as UTM codes, referrer, time zone (as a privacy-preserving proxy for country), and anonymized user agent values. These data points cannot be combined to track individual users or infringe on user privacy. 

We only use this data to provide aggregate metrics and nothing else. We drop IP addresses completely, do not store cookies, and do not collect or generate device identifiers.
