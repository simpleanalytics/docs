At Simple Analytics, our mission is to make web analytics **intuitive, ethical, and privacy-friendly**. 

We empower private and public organizations of all sizes with straightforward and actionable insights on your website traffic, easing compliance burdens and helping build trust with customers and visitors.

**We do not collect any personal data**. We do not use cookies and never collect information that could be used to fingerprint a user. You do not need to tweak any settings to make our software privacy-friendly:Â **Simple Analytics is privacy-friendly by design**.

Our minimal data collection still allows us to provide very valuable insights, including unique visitors, time on page, and the source of your traffic.

Privacy is not an afterthought; it is **the cornerstone of what we do**.
