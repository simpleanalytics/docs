At Simple Analytics, our mission is to make web analytics **straightforward, ethical, and privacy-friendly**. 

We empower organizations of all sizes with straightforward website analytics and actionable insights while easing compliance burdens and helping build trust with customers and visitors.

**We do not collect any personal data**. We do not use cookies and never collect information that could be used to fingerprint a user. You do not need to tweak any settings to make our software privacy-friendly:Â **Simple Analytics is privacy-friendly by design**.

Our minimal data collection still allows us to provide very valuable insights, including unique visitors, time on page, the source of your traffic, and much more. 

Privacy is not an afterthought; it is **the cornerstone of what we do**.
