Simple Analytics makes no claim over your data. We do not store, sell, or use it for our purposes. **Your data belongs to you**.

Your subscription pays for the service - not your data. We are an independently funded company with no ties to large corporations or the ad tech industry and do not use your data for marketing, for retargeting, for developing other services, and so on. And of course, we do not sell it.
