By not collecting personal data, we allow customers to use Simple Analytics **without needing consent** from end users or website visitors. This builds trust with users, provides a frictionless experience without annoying pop-ups, and avoids the significant data loss caused by cookie rejection and ad blockers. Some clients even use Simple Analytics alongside traditional cookie-based solutions to mitigate data loss from opt-outs.
