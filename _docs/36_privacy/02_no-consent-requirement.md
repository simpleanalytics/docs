By not collecting personal data, we allow customers to use Simple Analytics **without needing consent** from end users or website visitors. Yes, you don't need a consent banner while using Simple Analytics on your website. 

This builds trust with users, provides a frictionless experience without annoying pop-ups, and avoids the significant data loss caused by cookie rejection and ad blockers. 

Even if you use tools that require consent, you can run Simple Analytics "in front of your cookie banner." Some clients use Simple Analytics alongside traditional cookie-based solutions to mitigate data loss from opt-outs.
