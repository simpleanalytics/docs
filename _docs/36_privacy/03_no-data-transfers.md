We provide our service **without transferring data** outside the European Union. We rely on trusted, GDPR-compliant European data processors with data centers in the EU.

Because we do not collect personal data, we can forward data to our customers outside the EU with no compliance burden. This allows you to use Simple Analytics anywhere in the world without worrying about data transfers.
