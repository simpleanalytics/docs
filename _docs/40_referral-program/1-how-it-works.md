On [your referrals page](https://simpleanalytics.com/account/referrals?ref={{ site.hostname }}) you can create a personal referral link which you can share with others.

When people signup via your link:
- They get one month for free (one month extra free trial)
- You get paid **in cash** the value of one month of their chosen plan

## How it works for the referrer

Each referral will only be equivilant to one month's of their chosen plan.

Payment will only be paid into the credit card you have on file when the referred customer pays their first invoice.

Some examples:

| Subscription | New Customer Action | Your Outcome
| --- | --- | --- |
| Business plan (for $588 a year) | First invoice Paid | **You get $49** ($588 / 12) |
| Starter plan (for $19 a month) | First invoice Paid | **You get $19** |
| Starter plan (for $19 a month) | Cancel their plan within one month + 7 days | **You get nothing** |
| Starter plan (for $19 a month) | Fail to pay us | **You get nothing** |

> Go to [your referrals page](https://simpleanalytics.com/account/referrals?ref={{ site.hostname }}) to create your personal referral link

## How it works for new customers

When you click the **"Get one month for free"** button on the referral page you go to the main sales funnel of Simple Analytics. We will set a cookie with the referral code so we can apply the discount on checkout.

You will get **one month for free** so the trial period will be 37 days (instead of 7 days). During this period (or after) you can always cancel but we do not provide refunds.

When your first invoice has been paid, we will give the promoter of the referral link one month in cash.

Note: We are privacy focused, so the promoter will not receive any indication of who you are (i.e. you will be totally anonymous).
