## Framework plugins

For most frameworks you can just include the script. We track page views in a magic way so you don't have to change your app code. [Read on how we do that](/trigger-custom-page-views). For some we got requests to create a plugin for them.

Get our official plugins for these frameworks:

- [Gatsby](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-plugin-simple-analytics) <small>(source on [GitHub](https://github.com/simpleanalytics/gatsby-plugin#readme))</small>
