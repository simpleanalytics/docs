```html
<script async defer src="https://cdn.simpleanalytics.io/hello.js"></script>

> To install the script on Wordpress, Ghost, WIX, Squarespace, Webflow, Gatsby, Vue, Django, and others, go to [Install on other platforms](/install-on-other-platforms).

> Our user facing scripts are [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/simpleanalytics/scripts).

We have a website setup wizard to test if you installed your script correctly. If you still have problems installing it, please let us know! We helped a few people with setting up their script and we love to help you as well. Just [contact](https://simpleanalytics.com/contact?ref={{ site.hostname }}) us.
