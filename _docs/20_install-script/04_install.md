## Framework plugins

For most frameworks, you can include the script. We magically track page views, so you don't have to change your app code. [Read on how we do that](/trigger-custom-page-views). For some, we got requests to create a plugin for them.

{% assign currentDate = 'now' | date: '%s' | plus: 0 %}
{% assign threeMonthsLater = '2023-02-07' | date: '%s' | plus: 7884000 %}
