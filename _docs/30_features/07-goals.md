Our goals feature is really helpful for organizing and understanding your data. With it, you can set up filters for your data and view the results in these cool goal cards. The cards make it easy to see how you're doing at a glance.

## Overview

It's a good but simple introduction, but if you want to make the most of your goals, be sure to check out the rest of this article. We've included some helpful tips and information on how to use the feature to its full potential.

## Funnel

In our next video, we'll show you how to set up a new goal with a filter that targets page views from the home page. We'll also demonstrate how to add an additional step to the goal by filtering page views from the pricing page. This will give you a more comprehensive view of how your pricing page is performing.
