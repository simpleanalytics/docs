Custom views help you to have permanent filters on your dashboard, merge multiple domains into one dashboard, or give others access to a limited subset of the data.

> You need to have the Team subscription to use custom views.

1. Start by [creating a custom view](https://dashboard.simpleanalytics.com/views/create).
2. Select the websites you want to include in the view. If you are part of multiple teams, you can only include websites from the same team in one custom view.

3. Optionally, you can add filters to custom views. This can be useful if you want to exclude some pages or give someone access to only a subset of the website data.

4. Create a name for the view.
