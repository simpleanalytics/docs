## Moving from Iceland to The Netherlands

A year ago we wrote [a blog post](https://blog.simpleanalytics.io/why-we-moved-our-servers-to-iceland) about why we moved to Iceland. In hindsight, this was not a great move. Here is why:

1. The Icelandic Modern Media Initiative was adopted by parliament but didn’t make it into law (so it’s not the internet freedom haven we thought it was).
1. Our provider claimed to be the largest in Iceland but it was not as mature as bigger providers in Europe, which risked the security of our servers and infrastructure.
1. They had downtime twice this year.
1. The internet cables to Iceland are rather slow. Although it’s geographically ideal — located between North America and Europe — in practice, The Netherlands is a faster location.
1. We don't want to move to Switzerland because it would be a marketing move only. The EU provides better privacy laws than Switzerland.
1. We need to move anyway because our current provider does not offer the powerful servers we need.
1. The second-biggest provider in Iceland is legally headquartered in Honk Kong, which is not a location we want to store our data in.

We asked our customers if they would be okay with the move and everybody who voted agreed with our decision.

## Protecting your privacy

What do we do to protect your privacy and that of your visitors?

1. **We only collect what we need and nothing more.** This data probably won't be of much interest to thieves.
1. **You are in control of your data, and you can download or delete it at any time.** We don't own any of it.
1. **The drives storing your data are fully encrypted.** If anybody did manage to steal them, they'd be useless.
1. **We will never sell your data.** Because, once again, it's yours!
